<p>Hello, friends! I am Tony: a problem-solving Software Engineer with half a decade of experience specializing in building websites for small businesses focusing on back end, UX, UI, and accessibility.</p>

<p>My passion for coding is an accidental one, I wanted to become a doctor until my dream was shuttered by a fatal sickness - cerebral Malaria. Fortunately, I was able to pass the subjects that allowed me to do Computer related courses. Much as I could not solve human - health problems, I believe There is an even greater joy in solving real-world problems using one line of code at a time.</p>

<p>My latest work experience is with True African where I serve as a Software Engineer handling many client's projects as well as maintaining a legacy codebase of a few of True African's infrastructure. I am also remotely freelancing as a Full Stack Software Engineer with Learning Dollars.</p>

<p>In My previous experience with Andela, a remote software development talent company I worked asynchronously across 5 time zones with a remote team of junior web developers to optimize their code to make it world-class by providing ASK feedback on technical code reviews and assistance on 1 on 1 Zoom calls. By being proactive, I was assigned 3 roles here, Technical Support Engineer, Technical Content Writer, and Volunteer Mentor.</p>

<p>Feel free to learn more about me on my personal portfolio <a href="https://nataanthoni.github.io"> here</a></p>

<p>I am open to job opportunities. I would love to schedule a quick 15-minute Zoom call if I seem like a match. Would you have some time in the next week? If so, please reach out by sending me an email at nataanthoni@gmail.com.</p>
