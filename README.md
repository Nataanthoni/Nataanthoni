<p>Hello, friends! I am Tony: a problem-solving Software Engineer with half a decade of experience specializing in building websites for small businesses focusing on back end, UX, UI, and accessibility.</p>

<p>My passion for coding is an accidental one, I wanted to become a doctor until my dream was shuttered by a fatal sickness - cerebral Malaria. Fortunately, I was able to pass the subjects that allowed me to do Computer related courses. Much as I could not solve human - health problems, I believe There is an even greater joy in solving real-world problems using one line of code at a time.</p>

<p>My latest work experience is with True African where I serve as a Software Engineer handling many client's projects as well as maintaining a legacy codebase of a few of True African's infrastructure. I am also remotely freelancing as a Full Stack Software Engineer with Learning Dollars.</p>

<p>In My previous experience with andela, a remote software development talent company I worked asynchronously across 5 time zones with a remote team of junior web developers to optimize their code to make it world-class by providing ASK feedback on technical code reviews and assistance on 1 on 1 Zoom calls. By being proactive, I was assigned 3 roles here, Technical Support Engineer, Technical Content Writer, and Volunteer Mentor.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love to attend hackathons and host quiz nights. My team 4olio was runners-up at the 2015 MTN App Challenge Hackathon. I am also passionate about teaching others and volunteer as a Learning Facilitator, Mentor, and Tech evangelist.</p>

<p>Front-End: JavaScript, ReactJS, HTML5, CSS, SCSS, SASS, Bootstrap. Back-End: Python (Django, Django RFW), Laravel, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB. Professional Skills: Holistic Big Picture Thinking, Agile Project Management, Remote Pair Programming, Mentoring, Tutoring, Teamwork, Cross-Cultural Communication Skills, Organizing tech events, Test Driven Development, and Continuous Learning. Tools: Heroku, GitHub, Netlify, Slack, Zoom, Travis CI, Code Climate, Linting.</p>

<p>I am open to job opportunities. I would love to schedule a quick 15-minute Zoom call if I seem like a match. Would you have some time in the next week? If so, please reach out by sending me an email at nataanthoni@gmail.com.</p>
